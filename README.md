# TNDb-movie-data

The TMDb movie data contains information on release dates, runtimes, budget and revenues as well as on directors and actors, popularity and other topics, regarding movies since 1960.

I addressed the following questions:

- Which genres are most frequent from year to year?
- What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
- Which directors were most popular per year?
- Movies coming out in which season generated most revenues?
- Movies with which actors generate most revenues?
- What kinds of properties are associated with the most popular keyword(s) compared to the ones with lower popularity values?
